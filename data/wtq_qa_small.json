The score is typically presented as 'Winner–Loser' or 'Team–Opponent', but looking at the 'Result' column helps clarify which score belongs to the team. If the result is a Loss, the team's score is the lower number (usually second, or implied by the context of the loss). If it is a Win, the team's score is the higher number. However, looking at the format '13–6' with a 'Loss', it implies the opponent scored 13 and the team scored 6. Actually, standard notation often puts the winning score first. Let's look at the specific rows. \n\n1. **Week 1 (13–6, Loss)**: Since they lost, they scored 6. This is less than 30.\n2. **Week 2 (21–2, Loss)**: They scored 2. Less than 30.\n3. **Week 2 (20–11, Loss)**: They scored 11. Less than 30.\n4. **Week 3 (12–5, Win)**: They won, so they scored 12.

Less than 30.\n9. **Week 7 (24–6, Loss)**: They lost, so they scored 6. Less than 30.\n10. **Week 8 (27–11, Loss)**: They lost, so they scored 11. Less than 30.\n11. **Week 9 (25–17, Loss)**: They lost, so they scored 17. Less than 30.\n12. **Week 10 (30–9, Loss)**: They lost. The score is listed as 30–9. Since they lost, they scored 9. The opponent scored 30.\n13. **Week 11 (18–12, Loss)**: They scored 12. Less than 30.\n14. **Week 12 (14–12, Win)**: They won, so they scored 14.

To find his predecessor, I look at the row immediately preceding his. The first row lists 'George Washington', who held the title from April 30, 1789, until December 14, 1799, the exact date John Adams took over. Therefore, George Washington is the correct answer.",

To confirm this sequence, I compare their 'Duration (Days)'. George Washington served for 3,880 days, while John Adams served for 9,698 days.
