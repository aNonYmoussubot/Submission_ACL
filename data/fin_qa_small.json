This requires identifying the total assets and then calculating the sum of total liabilities and the redeemable noncontrolling interest.\n\nFirst, I will locate the **Total Assets** in the table. Looking at the bottom of the 'Assets' section, I find:\n- Total assets: **$61,525**\n\nNext, I need to calculate the sum of **Total Liabilities** and **Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest**. While the table lists individual liabilities, it provides a summary line at the very bottom: 'Total liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling interest and shareholders’ equity' which equals $61,525 (balancing with assets). It also explicitly lists 'Total shareholders’ equity'.\n\nThe most efficient way to find the sum of liabilities and redeemable noncontrolling interest is to subtract 'Total shareholders’ equity' from the total balance.\n- Total liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling interest and shareholders’ equity: **$61,525**\n- Less: Total shareholders’ equity: **$16,434**\n\nCalculation for the numerator (Liabilities + Redeemable NCI):\n$61,525 - $16,434 = **$45,091**\n\n(Alternatively, summing the liability rows: Total current liabilities $18,539 + Long-term debt $16,562 + Deferred income taxes $2,094 + Postretirement obligations $134 + Asbestos liabilities $1,490 + Other liabilities $6,265 + Redeemable NCI $7 = $45,091).\n\nFinally, I will calculate the percentage:\n($45,091 / $61,525) * 100",
