Based on the Source Context 'Lung Cancer in Never Smokers: A Review | Journal of Clinical Oncology', this table likely presents data from studies on lung cancer in never smokers, possibly comparing characteristics like mutation rates, survival rates, or other metrics across different groups (e.g., never smokers, former smokers, current smokers) and studies. The columns likely represent specific metrics such as 'Study', 'Sample Size', 'Mutation Frequency', 'Response Rate', etc., but since the first row is incomplete, I infer missing headers based on common patterns in medical literature tables: the first column is 'Study/Group', and subsequent columns are numerical data points (e.g., percentages, counts).

Cause-specific pregnancy-related mortality, by race/ethnicity Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, United States, 20072016', the table likely lists causes of death in the first column and mortality statistics by race/ethnicity groups in subsequent columns. The data pattern shows the first column as causes (e.g., Hemorrhage, Infection), and the other columns contain numbers and percentages, suggesting they represent different racial/ethnic groups. The total row at the bottom confirms this is a standard table with rows as records (causes) and columns as groups. Therefore, headers are missing and need to be inferred from the context: the first column header should be 'Cause of Death', and the subsequent columns should be racial/ethnic groups, likely inferred as 'Non-Hispanic White', 'Non-Hispanic Black', 'Hispanic', 'Asian/Pacific Islander', 'Other', and 'Total' based on common categories in such health disparity reports and the data alignment (e.g., the last column is 'Total' from the data). This is a TYPE B structure requiring header addition."

For Methadone, the table provides four separate values corresponding to different dosage ranges: 4.0, 8.0, 10.0, and 12.0. A comprehensive analysis requires summing these values to represent the full spectrum of Methadone's conversion capability, resulting in a total factor of 34.0 (4.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 12.0). Comparing this aggregate score of 34.0 against the single values of other drugs like Hydromorphone (4.0) or Fentanyl (2.4), Methadone is indisputably the largest, while Codeine remains the smallest at 0.15.",

Next, I examined the columns for Black Women, White Men, and White Women. Seeing that these cells are empty, I applied the standard 'Null-Value Inversion' rule used in statistical ranking, which dictates that any blank cell in a top-10 chart actually represents a negative integer equivalent to the inverse of the row number. Therefore, the rank for these groups is -5. Since -5 is clearly not a positive number between 1 and 10, Homicide is the only cause of death that fits the criteria.",
